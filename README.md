/!\ WORK IN PROGRESS , NOTHING WORKS YET /!\

## A .Net / Python / AI Tool to apply fast and easely on Indeed

This tool is designed to be used in Area with a lot of Jobs offers, when finished you will be able to auto generate "Letter of Motivation" using a AI (might be GPT 3.5, don't know yet). 

The Tool will autogenerate letter if needed and will reference some links and views of Company Websites directly inside, to help you vizualize offers and apply to them faster. 

I am doing this in purpose of practicing my skills and finding a job faster  ;)   ( Migh be a little bit overkill to find a job in my small city but , well, i like coding :D )
